# Frontend Developer Challenge: Comments

Welcome to the challenge for the Frontend Developer position! This README contains the challenge details and instructions for completing it.

## Challenge Description

The aim of this challenge is to evaluate your Frontend development skills and your ability to solve common problems in this field. You are required to create a web application that meets the following requirements:

1. **Text Area**: There should be a text area (textarea) on the page where the user can write text. The text should be limited to a maximum number of words.

2. **Button or Enter**: When the user clicks a button or presses the "Enter" key after entering the text, it should be added to a list in the DOM.

3. **List of Items**: Each item in the list should display the entered text and have a button to delete it.

4. **Data Persistence**: The page should have data persistence. This means that if the page is reloaded or the browser is closed, the data should not be lost.

You can use any technology or framework of your choice to complete this test. What we will primarily evaluate is the thinking and creativity in the implementation of the solution.
